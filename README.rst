Introduction
------------

Probabilistic data structures is a common name of data structures
based on different hashing techniques.

Unlike regular (or deterministic) data structures, they always provide approximated answers, but usually with reliable ways to estimate the error probability.

The potential losses or errors are fully compensated by extremely
low memory requirements, constant query time and scaling.


The Book
---------

"Probabilistic Data Structures and Algorithms" is a technical book about such popular space-efficient data structures and algorithms that mostly based on various hashing techniques.

Currently, the book is in a draft stage and is planning to be released in 2018.
